# Client-Server News Application
- i finished with the basic connection **we still got the list and the actual coding** ðŸ‘€
- im facing a problem with the request params thats why i commented it ... i think we should do it in deferent functions to make it easy to understand? im still workining
- invalid numbers problems rolls back to the begining of the main menu (im thinking i coukd create a loop only goes once? or a flag while?)
- The choice sending issue might be from the while loop in client (or a logic error), or it might be from the server side sice it doesn't have a loop to recieve every time (idk just a wild guess). **Must be checked**.
- list all new headlines **doesnt work changed it to us**
- Check numbers and characters' errors in options
