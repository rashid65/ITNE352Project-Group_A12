# Client-Server News Application
- i finished with the basic connection **we still got the list and the actual coding** ðŸ‘€
- Theres a problem i just thought of we need to manage how to throwback the server after user selecting "back to main menu" option to not be confused with the numbers? im trying to fix it now
- im facing a problem with the request params thats why i commented it
- The choice sending issue might be from the while loop in client (or a logic error), or it might be from the server side sice it doesn't have a loop to recieve every time (idk just a wild guess). **Must be checked**.
